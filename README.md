# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game in Python

## Overview

This project implements the **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock** game
using Python. It expands on the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors game by
including two additional weapons: Lizard and Spock. The game logic is
based on a series of rules that determine which weapon wins or loses in
each round. You can play against a computer opponent, and the game
provides feedback based on the results of each round.

## Game Rules

The game rules are as follows: - **Rock**: crushes Lizard, breaks
Scissors - **Paper**: disproves Spock, wraps Rock - **Scissors**: kills
Lizard, cuts Paper - **Lizard**: poisons Spock, eats Paper - **Spock**:
vaporizes Rock, smashes Scissors
